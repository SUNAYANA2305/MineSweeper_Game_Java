# MineSweeper_Game_Java
Implementing Minesweeper GAME with the following restrictions:

Levels: "Beginner", "Advanced" and "Expert".
Board size: Beginner: board 7x9 and 10 mines, 
            Advanced: board 13x18 and 35 mines,
            Expert: board 22x25 and 91 mines.

It contains timer that displays the number of seconds played so far, if the clock reaches 1 minute for Beginner, 3 minutes for Advanced or 10 minutes for Expert then the game is lost and the mines should explode.
It contains some small animation of mines exploding and exploding sound (Warning: My game sound could give you heartattack... lol :D :P).
